'   Abstract:       This Template provides functionality linking Excel to
'                   Platform for Science or Core LIMS
'
'                   Current Versions use the JSON API not  OData
'
'                   The target audience is those **NEW** to Visual Basic for
'                   Applications (VBA). Coding is styled for readability.
'                   This is intended as a template, start point or utility.

'                   This module is for notes, version information and scope of
'                   functionality for this template workbook.
'
'                   **** No hardcoded values are in the code ****
'
'                   For any 'hardcoded' values look in mciConstants
'
'                   This code is "free" but the hours figuring it out/debugging
'                   it are not ;-)
'
'                   Suggest this is kept as a template not an installed Add-in
'                   for security and installation headaches.
